In this document we will discuss why we need such technologies and what is the expected outcome from each library or choice.

We will try to define some conventions, patterns and best practices that should be followed in the process of code development of the project.

TLD'R! this is the following syllabus summarizing the main topics that will be discussed:

- ✨ Expected outcome ✨
- Libraries
- Conventions
- Best practices
